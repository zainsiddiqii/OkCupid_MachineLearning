In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. 
Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience.
These apps give us access to a wealth of information that weâ€™ve never had before about how different people experience romance.


The dataset itself is too large to upload on GitHub so until I figure that out, you can find the dataset on codecademy's website.
I have obtained this dataset from https://www.codecademy.com and have used supervised learning algorithms from scikit-learn to make the models.
I try to predict the sexual orientation of users on the app (['straight','bisexual','gay']) using three different classification algorithms.
I first perform some EDA and cleaning on the dataset, after which I get the data ready for ML. I also discuss the setbacks faced on the way to building the models.
At the end, I write a conclusion based on my findings.
